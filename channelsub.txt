I try and passing on my 30 plus years of military and police experience to others.  My Bio is on my website.

I support gun ownership and educated gun owners. For those in other countries that may not be able to own guns, I assure you, if someone has a gun, you may find yourself in a situation where you could or may have to pick up a gun and defend yourself or your family. This channel will prepare you for that moment should it ever come.

Better to Have a Gun and not need it, than to need a gun and not have it. 

Enjoy the channel.

Generally categorized as an alternative rock band, the band are known for their highly eclectic catalog of songs inspired by funk, soul, country, gospel, prog, psychedelia, R&B, heavy metal, punk rock, and countless more.
Ween self-released several cassette albums from their formation until 1989. Afterward, they put out three officially-released lo-fi albums: GodWeenSatan: The Oneness; The Pod; and Pure Guava. For Pure Guava, the band signed with major label Elektra Records. The album spawned the single "Push th' Little Daisies", which was a chart hit in Australia and the United States. Under Elektra, the band released four professionally-recorded albums: Chocolate and Cheese; 12 Golden Country Greats; The Mollusk; and White Pepper. They later returned to independent labels for their albums Quebec and La Cucaracha. After a 28-year run, Freeman quit the band in 2012, citing the need to focus on his alcohol and drug addiction issues.","publishedAt":"2019-06-22T15:15:03.100876Z","title":"Ween - Topic","resourceId":{"channelId":"UCXWUt1Cu2hVZYTaJ44ddusA","kind":"youtube#channel","playlistId":null,"videoId":null},"thumbnails":{"default":{"height":null,"url":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/jOREMMs_2dssp6XIvz9vBc7uPEpKkkKaXgXwd0n2pGVqzACtVMR1iJQIg_z2RaDCogtaKxYx=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","width":null},"medium":{"height":null,"url":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/jOREMMs_2dssp6XIvz9vBc7uPEpKkkKaXgXwd0n2pGVqzACtVMR1iJQIg_z2RaDCogtaKxYx=s240-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","width":null},"high":{"height":null,"url":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/jOREMMs_2dssp6XIvz9vBc7uPEpKkkKaXgXwd0n2pGVqzACtVMR1iJQIg_z2RaDCogtaKxYx=s800-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","width":null}}}},{"etag":"HOrbOj1rC52-MzTwSbp_T35E0l0","id":"fcNZU_EdobhnQy0Zs9JDjglHx6qpKuwqBLhnQ4L07EY","kind":"youtube#subscription","snippet":{"channelId":"UCvpxLETokd-293zt3E-b49g","channelTitle":null,"description":"Steve Gibson, the man who coined the term spyware and created the first anti-spyware program, creator of Spinrite and ShieldsUP, discusses the hot topics in security today with Leo Laporte.

Libertarian journalist John Stossel is a zealous advocate of free markets, a syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor. Prior to joining Fox, John co-anchored ABC’s primetime newsmagazine show, 20/20.  

Stossel’s economic programs have been adapted into teaching kits by a non-profit organization, "Stossel in the Classroom." High school teachers in American public schools now use the videos to help educate their students on economics and economic freedom. They are seen by more than 12 million students every year.

Stossel has received 19 Emmy Awards and has been honored five times for excellence in consumer reporting by the National Press Club. Other honors include the George Polk Award for Outstanding Local Reporting and the George Foster Peabody Award.","publishedAt":"2021-05-19T21:07:52.54807Z","title":"John Stossel","resourceId":{"channelId":"UCjo1uN-aM3rmBV46xj7l2KA","kind":"youtube#channel","playlistId":null,"videoId":null},"thumbnails":{"default":{"height":null,"url":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLStJ8Ma-RLekbPuSHwNLzhEF3SfKPCMD81d19H0uQ=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","width":null},"medium":{"height":null,"url":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLStJ8Ma-RLekbPuSHwNLzhEF3SfKPCMD81d19H0uQ=s240-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","width":null},"high":{"height":null,"url":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLStJ8Ma-RLekbPuSHwNLzhEF3SfKPCMD81d19H0uQ=s800-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","width":null}}}},{"etag":"h-Z7nRpqqNqVvJIC3_54oSSlpZo","id":"fcNZU_EdobhnQy0Zs9JDjlhrD0zPz-6TFOWbLWhTbCA","kind":"youtube#subscription","snippet":{"channelId":"UCvpxLETokd-293zt3E-b49g","channelTitle":null,"description":"The Joe Rogan Experience podcast","publishedAt":"2020-06-02T20:52:17.768642Z","title":"PowerfulJRE","resourceId":{"channelId":"UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ","kind":"youtube#channel","playlistId":null,"videoId":null},"thumbnails":{"default":{"height":null,"url":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS2KcFQ2ddXLYVpxbXNVqf7nsi0NWg4_R4HqKIl=s88-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","width":null},"medium":{"height":null,"url":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS2KcFQ2ddXLYVpxbXNVqf7nsi0NWg4_R4HqKIl=s240-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","width":null},"high":{"height":null,"url":"https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AKedOLS2KcFQ2ddXLYVpxbXNVqf7nsi0NWg4_R4HqKIl=s800-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj","width":null}}}},{"etag":"qe0v9zBHTsG66dDXy-UCpYX-X_k","id":"fcNZU_EdobhnQy0Zs9JDjk5sDbWkDjf_U52ODfTT_7U","kind":"youtube#subscription","snippet":{"channelId":"UCvpxLETokd-293zt3E-b49g","channelTitle":null,"description":"I started building websites in 1994 and have been teaching web design and programming for over 10yrs!
